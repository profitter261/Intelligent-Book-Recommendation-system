# Intelligent-Book-Recommendation-system
I have designed a Book recommendation system which will recommend multiple books on the type of the genre or the book you search for 

## Problem Statement
Design a book recommendation system that retrieves book details from given datasets, processes and cleans the data before applying NLP techniques and clustering methods and builds multiple recommendation models. The final application will allow users to search for book recommendations using a user-friendly interface deployed with Streamlit and hosted on AWS.

## Business Use Cases
- ***Personalized Reading Experience:*** Help readers discover books tailored to their preferences based on their reading history, genres, or authors.
- ***Enhanced Library Systems:*** Libraries and bookstores can use recommendations to improve book borrowing/sales based on popular or similar reads.
- ***Improved Author/Publisher Targeting:*** Provide authors and publishers with data-driven insights about popular genres, reader preferences, and high-demand books.
- ***Reader Engagement:*** Increase reader engagement by suggesting trending or highly rated books across different categories.
